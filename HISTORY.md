# Register updates
## Beta11. Remove duplicate lists
August 2016

Tony Worron is in discussions to retire the HMRC list of country ISO codes and the list of countries maintained by the Ministry of Defence. In both instances, updates will be required to existing web pages which need to be coordinated.

## Alpha10. Review feedback from alpha
August 2016

The Geographical Names Index was published.
July 2016

Workshop held to confirm the custodian succession plan. Assuming there are no organisational changes, custodianship of the country register should pass to the successor of Tony Worron’s role, with Tony’s custodian duties to be covered by another member of his team in the case of holiday or sickness.

In practicality, members of Tony’s team can update the register, and this raised a need for adequate training for those who will be using the register update tool and the ability for custodians to approve or amend these before being incorporated into the live register.

Amendments were suggested the Geographical Names Index. This is a page that provides useful context around the country register and specific guidance around the usage of certain country names.
May 2016

John Wright and Tony Worron, Desk Officer for Geographical Information Policy at FCO, took part in a workshop with GDS.

January 2016

GDS and the FCO updated the register based on their findings from discovery.

They agreed that FCO is ready to support the country register in beta.
Discovery6. Review how register is updated
December 2015

Tony Worron explained how the FCO formally recognises a change to a country name.

The country first tells the UK and other countries to change the way they refer to it. They’ll usually tell the United Nations (UN) at the same time if they’re a member.

Tony and his team talk to FCO’s post in that country if they need more information about the change.

The FCO decides if the name should be changed and tells the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN).

After the name has been changed, it can take a while before the name is updated in UN documents or ISO codes.
Discovery5. Review how feedback is collected
December 2015

GDS and FCO agreed to add an email link to each page of the country register. All feedback is sent to the registers team at GDS. Who replies will depend on if the feedback is about the product or the data.
Discovery4. Agree dataset
December 2015

FCO and GDS agreed the fields for the country register. They are:

    country (2 letter ISO 3166-2 code)
    name (commonly used name of a country)
    official-name (official name of a country)
    citizen-names (name of the citizens of a country)
    start-date (when the country was first recognised)
    end-date

They agreed not to include the following fields:

    country (3 letter ISO 3166-1 code)
    adjectival-name
    notes

The 3 letter ISO 3166-1 code isn’t needed as the register already includes the 2 letter code.

The information in the ‘adjectival-name’ and ‘notes’ fields wasn’t necessary to this first draft of the register.
Discovery3. Agree a custodian
November 2015

FCO suggested Tony Worron should be the custodian of the country register. Tony accepted the offer.
Backlog2. Register is accepted
November 2015

Country register was approved by Paul Downey at GDS.

FCO was accepted by GDS as the registry of the country register.

This is because the FCO sits on the board of the ISO naming committee
