# Register updates: Country
## Beta11. Remove duplicate lists
August 2016

Tony Worron is in discussions to retire the HMRC list of country ISO codes and the list of countries maintained by the Ministry of Defence. In both instances, updates will be required to existing web pages which need to be coordinated.

## Alpha10. Review feedback from alpha
August 2016

The Geographical Names Index was published.
July 2016

Workshop held to confirm the custodian succession plan. Assuming there are no organisational changes, custodianship of the country register should pass to the successor of Tony Worron’s role, with Tony’s custodian duties to be covered by another member of his team in the case of holiday or sickness.

In practicality, members of Tony’s team can update the register, and this raised a need for adequate training for those who will be using the register update tool and the ability for custodians to approve or amend these before being incorporated into the live register.

Amendments were suggested the Geographical Names Index. This is a page that provides useful context around the country register and specific guidance around the usage of certain country names.
May 2016

John Wright and Tony Worron, Desk Officer for Geographical Information Policy at FCO, took part in a workshop with GDS.

FCO and GDS agreed what needs to be done next to make the country register live.
February 2016

Presented country register at Sprint 16.

UK Parliament starts using the country register in its petitions service.

Tony Worron wrote a blog post about working with GDS to develop the country register.
Alpha9. Find duplicate lists

Reviewed existing duplicate country lists. There are 19 duplicate country lists published by 8 different departments.
Alpha8. Meet technical standards

The country register meets the technical standards as it’s hosted by the GDS on the open register platform.
Alpha7. Meet operational standards

The country register meets the operational standards as it’s hosted by GDS on the open register platform.
January 2016

GDS and the FCO updated the register based on their findings from discovery.

They agreed that FCO is ready to support the country register in beta.
Discovery6. Review how register is updated
December 2015

Tony Worron explained how the FCO formally recognises a change to a country name.

The country first tells the UK and other countries to change the way they refer to it. They’ll usually tell the United Nations (UN) at the same time if they’re a member.

Tony and his team talk to FCO’s post in that country if they need more information about the change.

The FCO decides if the name should be changed and tells the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN).

After the name has been changed, it can take a while before the name is updated in UN documents or ISO codes.
Discovery5. Review how feedback is collected
December 2015

GDS and FCO agreed to add an email link to each page of the country register. All feedback is sent to the registers team at GDS. Who replies will depend on if the feedback is about the product or the data.
Discovery4. Agree dataset
December 2015

FCO and GDS agreed the fields for the country register. They are:

    country (2 letter ISO 3166-2 code)
    name (commonly used name of a country)
    official-name (official name of a country)
    citizen-names (name of the citizens of a country)
    start-date (when the country was first recognised)
    end-date

They agreed not to include the following fields:

    country (3 letter ISO 3166-1 code)
    adjectival-name
    notes

The 3 letter ISO 3166-1 code isn’t needed as the register already includes the 2 letter code.

The information in the ‘adjectival-name’ and ‘notes’ fields wasn’t necessary to this first draft of the register.
Discovery3. Agree a custodian
November 2015

FCO suggested Tony Worron should be the custodian of the country register. Tony accepted the offer.
Backlog2. Register is accepted
November 2015

Country register was approved by Paul Downey at GDS.

FCO was accepted by GDS as the registry of the country register.

This is because the FCO sits on the board of the ISO naming committee

## Backlog1. Request a register
25 October 2015

Country register was proposed by Chris Ferguson, Director of Digital for GDS.

It was described as a reliable list of country names recognised by the UK government.

7 December 2016

Tony Worron and the Register Design Authority agreed to take the text field out of the register itself and add the contents to the geographical names index page on GOV.UK. This is because information in the text field provides context around the data in the register that can (and likely will) change depending on the geopolitical climate. This will have no bearing on the raw data.

Any notes about the territories can be added to the country and territory names: more information publication that’s linked to from the list of UK Overseas Territory names on that the geographical names index on GOV.UK.

Tony Worron provided updates to the register data, including changes to the name and ‘official-name’ fields for a number of entries.
Alpha9. Find duplicate lists
June 2016

In working with Tony Worron on both the country and territory registers, we found 19 government documents, data and services that include lists of countries and territories. We used these lists to produce this report.
Alpha8. Meet technical standards
26 August 2016

The territory register will be hosted on the Open Register platform and so conforms to the technical standards.
Alpha7. Meet operational standards
26 August 2016

The territory register will be hosted on the Open Register platform and so conforms to the operational standards.
Discovery6. Review how register is updated
20 July 2016

Tony Worron explained how the FCO acknowledges a change to a territory as understood for the purposes of this register.

The territory first declares a change to the way they refer to it.

Where relevant, Tony and his team talk to FCO’s post in that territory if they need more information about the change.

The FCO decides if the name should be changed and, where relevant, tells the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN).

After the name has been changed, it can take a while before the name is updated or new territories are given ISO codes.
Discovery5. Review how feedback is collected
20 July 2016

GDS and FCO agreed to add an email link to each page of the territory register. All feedback is sent to the registers team at GDS. Who replies will depend on if the feedback is about the product or the data.
Discovery4. Agree dataset
26 August 2016

Initial dataset provided by FCO and loaded into the alpha register.
20 July 2016

Workshop held between GDS and FCO to review the proposed data model and initial dataset of the territory register.

FCO and GDS agreed the fields for the territory register. They are: - territory (ISO 3166-1 code - Tony Worron provided unique codes for those territories that don’t have an ISO code) - name (approved British English-language name) - official-name (official name of the territory) - start-date (first date this entry became applicable) - end-date (last date this entry was applicable) - text (useful context about a territory)

They agreed not to include: - production-note

The ‘production-note’ field wasn’t needed as this was used by FCO and GDS to share feedback on the register as the data model was evolving.
Discovery3. Agree a custodian
20 June 2016

FCO suggested Tony Worron should be the custodian of the territory register. Tony accepted the offer.
Backlog2. Register is accepted
20 June 2016

Territory register was approved by Paul Downey at GDS.

FCO was accepted by GDS as the registry of the territory register.

This is because FCO defines and maintains any relationships the United Kingdom has with the territories contained in the register.
Backlog1. Request a register
31 May 2016

Territory register proposed by Dan Higgs, Project Lead at the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Tony Worron, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and Paul Downey from the registers team at GDS.

It was described as a reliable list of all political, administrative and geographical entities that are not countries but need to be referenced by a range of services across government.
